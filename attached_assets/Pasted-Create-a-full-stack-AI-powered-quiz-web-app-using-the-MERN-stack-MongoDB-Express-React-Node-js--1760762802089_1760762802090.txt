Create a full-stack AI-powered quiz web app using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and the OpenRouter DeepSeek API. The app should let users select a quiz topic (like Science, History, JavaScript) and set a timer (1, 2, or 5 minutes). When the quiz starts, the backend will call the DeepSeek API to generate 5 multiple-choice questions, each with 4 options and one correct answer. The frontend, built with React and styled using TailwindCSS, should display the questions, handle user answers, and show a live countdown timer using a custom useTimer hook. When time runs out or the user submits, the app should automatically send the answers to the backend, which then uses DeepSeek again to analyze the performance and return JSON data including score, strengths, weaknesses, suggestions, and motivational feedback. The React app should have three main components: QuizSetup (topic and timer selection), QuizPage (questions and timer), and AnalysisPage (AI feedback). The backend should have two routes: GET /api/question?topic=<topic> to fetch AI-generated questions and POST /api/analyze to get the analysis. Use the DeepSeek endpoint https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions with model "deepseek/deepseek-chat" and include the OpenRouter API key in an .env file. Example prompts for DeepSeek: for question generation — “Generate 5 multiple-choice quiz questions about TOPIC, each with 4 options and one correct answer, respond only in valid JSON format”; for analysis — “Analyze this quiz performance {user’s answers in JSON} and return JSON with score, strengths, weaknesses, suggestions, and feedback.” In React, implement a countdown timer hook like useTimer(duration, onExpire) to auto-submit when time hits zero. Store optional user history in MongoDB with fields like topic, score, and date. The folder structure should have client (React app with components for setup, quiz, and analysis) and server (Express backend with routes and integration to DeepSeek). Set "proxy": "http://localhost:5000" in client/package.json for easy API calls. The .env file should include OPENROUTER_API_KEY and PORT. Optionally, add features like progress bars, AI difficulty adjustment, and user history charts using Recharts. The final result should be a working AI quiz app that generates questions, tracks time, and gives personalized AI-based feedback
